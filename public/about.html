<body>
    <p>I'm Boyd Querubin, a 32-year-old originally from the Philippines. I recently became a naturalized <br/>
    citizen of the United States. I'm fluent in both English and Tagalog, speaking them both as if they <br/>
    were my native languages.</p>

    <p>I'm a husband and a father of three wonderful children. My journey started with a Communications <br/>
        degree, and since graduating in 2019, I've been working as a Marketer/Content Creator. <br/>
        However, I'm currently in the process of learning Web Design, as I'm planning to make a career change <br/>
         in the near future. As part of this transition, I'm actively working on creating an Online Portfolio <br/>
          from scratch, which is my current project.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball, learning to code, and spending quality time with my wife and kids.</p>
